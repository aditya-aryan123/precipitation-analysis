Daily precipitation values was analyzed for three districts of Chattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh from 2010 to 2022 (12 years),the data have been collected from Visual Crossing, a weather api service platform. Trends in monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation stations Bansagar Dam, Indrapuri Barrage, Old Chopan, and Jawahar Setu were examined in this study. Trend analysis of rainfall data series for 2012–2022 did not show any clear trend for the region as a whole, although there are seasonal trends for some seasons and for some hydro-meteorological stations. Notably for the post-monsoon season, the Sen's estimator of slope ( °C/year) was 0.019, 0.011, and 0.015 for the maximum, minimum, and mean temperature, respectively
